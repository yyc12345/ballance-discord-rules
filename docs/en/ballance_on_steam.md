**Ziggurat states that they acquired the rights from Atari, the original publisher of Ballance, so there is no question of the legality of Ziggurat Ballance on Steam and GOG, and you are free to purchase it.**

TL;DR  
Hold off on purchasing Ballance from Steam for now. Let's wait for a response from Ziggurat or the original Ballance developer team.

Recent updates to the Ballance page on Steam, as indicated by SteamDB, suggest that Ziggurat is actively preparing for the release of Ballance on the platform. However, considering the available information, the legality of Ballance on Steam might not be definitive. Here's our statement regarding Ziggurat's release of Ballance on Steam.

The Ballance community is eager for a robust platform to better organize and unite the player community. Currently, our communication largely relies on Discord, which has limitations, and managing user-generated content demands extra effort and resources from our moderators. A recognized platform like Steam could significantly attract former players and newcomers alike. Moreover, Steam's Workshop-like features could streamline the management of user-generated content such as custom maps and BML mods, making them more accessible to everyone. This eliminates the need for additional expenses on servers or websites to host these essential resources. Additionally, map and mod creators can easily showcase their work on this platform without concerns about accessibility.

At first glance, the prospect of Ballance being on Steam appears promising, but it hinges on the legitimacy of Ziggurat's release. If we invest our efforts into an unauthorized release that ends up facing a DMCA takedown, all our work would be in vain. It's crucial that our actions are based on a solid and trustworthy source to focus on nurturing our community rather than worrying about potential disruptions to our efforts.

Following a meeting in March involving Chris and Alith from the community, along with Ulrich Weinberg (Ballance IP host), it's evident that the original Ballance developer team hasn't granted any authority to Ziggurat. Ulrich Weinberg himself wasn't familiar with Ziggurat before this meeting. This lack of a license or charter from Ziggurat raises doubts about the legitimacy of their Ballance release, at least for now.

However, other community members have shed more light on Ziggurat. One member noted that the CEO of Ziggurat previously worked at Atari, which published Ballance 19 years ago. This connection seemingly confirms the legality of Ziggurat's release without necessitating challenges. Additionally, there's uncertainty among some Ballance developers regarding the ownership of the game IP, suggesting that Ziggurat might indeed possess the game IP and distribute it freely.

During the March Meeting, Ulrich Weinberg mentioned his inability to intervene with a "Coming Soon" game on Steam but assured action upon the actual Steam release. Around a month ago, Chris emailed Ulrich Weinberg regarding this matter but received no response, not even a reply on Discord. This lack of communication clouds the true stance of the original Ballance development team. Speculations are arising within the community that Ziggurat and Ulrich Weinberg might have reached a consensus without informing us. This is a critical concern as it shapes our stance towards Ballance on Steam. To protect copyright interests, we unequivocally oppose any potentially profitable unlawful release of Ballance, especially one that doesn't benefit the original Ballance team financially. If there's a contractual agreement between the Ballance team and Ziggurat, it's essential to inform the community; otherwise, our stance remains: no promotion, no purchase, and no support for Ziggurat's Ballance.

Some might argue that our intent is to bring down Ziggurat and enforce the use of distribution solely through our server. This isn't accurate. As mentioned earlier, our desire for a legal Ballance on Steam is paramount, driven by both nostalgic attachment to Ballance and the responsibility as moderators of the Ballance community. Our stance on Ziggurat's Ballance remains undecided. Clarity will emerge once Ziggurat or the Ballance team responds. We urge everyone to refrain from purchasing Ballance on Steam based on the evidence we've gathered. Let's remain patient and await a response from Ziggurat or the original Ballance developer team.
